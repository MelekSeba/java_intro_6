RECAP:

Arrays: 
-It is a collection that stores similar-multiple data
-Collections: Arrays, ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, Queue
	Arrays is the base for all the other collections
-Each data we have in the array is known as ELEMENT
-Array can be empty or you can have as many values inside it
-Arrays are fixed sized. So, once you declare the array, it is not possible to change the length by adding or removing



HOW TO INITIALIZE AN ARRAY?
SYNTAX:
-If you know the number elements but you don't know what they are
dataType[] varName = new dataType[capacity];
int[] ages = new int[3]; // I will store 3 numbers here

-if you already know what are your elements
dataType[] varName = {el1, el2, el3, el4};
String[] countries = {"Belgium", "Germany", "USA"};


-Declaring an array
dataType[] varName;

-Assigning an array
varName = new dataType[capacity];


String name; //declaration
name = "John"; // assignment
String name = "John"; // declaration and initialization



CAN WE CHANGE THE LENGTH OF AN ARRAY AFTER INITIALIZING?
- No, arrays are fixed sized and they cannot be modified with their initial capacity.



HOW TO PRINT THE ARRAYS?
1. Convert it to a String
2. Print your String

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arrayVariable));



HOW TO FIND THE SIZE OF AN ARRAY? HOW MANY ELEMENTS YOU HAVE?
-We can find it by length property

	arrayVariable.length; //  returns the size as an int



FOR EACH LOOP
-It is known as enhanced for loop
-It was introduced with later Java versions
-It can only be used with collections like arrays, lists, sets, maps
-For each loop does not allow you to start from the middle or the last
-When you need to update collection elements, it is better to use fori loop


SYNTAX:
for(dataType varName : collection){
	/code block
}


NULL KEYWORD
-PRIMITIVES cannot be null
-Objects can be defined as null
-null means your variable is not pointing any value in the memory
-null means there is no value
-NullPointerException

MEMORY

String name = null; // ""

String address = "Chicago";

address.charAt(0); // 'C'




Phone number





DEFAULT VALUES:
boolean[] numbers = boolean int[3]; // [false, false, false]

byte, short, int, long 	-> 0
float, double 			-> 0.0
char 					-> 
boolean 				-> false
Object 					-> null


Double[] d = new Double[2]; // [null, null]
float[] f = new float[3]; // [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

Boolean[] b = new Boolean[3]; // [null, null, null]

Wrapper classes -> Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean
