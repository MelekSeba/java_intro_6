String name = "John";

int age = 45;


Collections - Data structures
-There are many collections or data structures that programming languages provides.
-Some allow duplicates, some does not
-Some of them sorts the given values by default, some does not
	sort = ordering
-Some has more difference than the others


-Every value you put in the array is known as ELEMENT


Store all the group names and their ages
String member1Name = "John";
String member2Name = "Alex";


String[] names = {"John", "Alex"};
int[] ages = {45, 30};
char[] chars = {'#', 'g', '$'};
double[] balances = {10, 12.5, 5.3};
boolean[] booleans = {true, false, false};



HOW MANY ELEMENTS I HAVE IN THE ARRAY
names.length; // 2
chars.length; // 3


HOW TO GET A PARTICULAR ELEMENT FROM THE ARRAY
names[1]; // Alex
balances[2]; // 5.3


booleans[5]; // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ages[-1]; // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException



int member1Age = 45;
int member2Age = 30;



FOR EACH LOOP

for(dataType variableName : collection){
	// block of code to be executed
}
