Loops
	-


1. for loop - i loop - traditional loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for each loop - used with collections



INFINITE LOOP: this is the loop you have a mistake and never stops.
The update is not going towards the termination condition

for(initialization; termination; update){
	
}

for(int i = 10; i < 20; i--){ // infinite loop
	
}

for(; ;){ // infinite loop
	
}


OCA EXAM: JAVA Certification



A LOOP THAT NEVER RUN:
-When the condition is false for the first iteration, then the loop does not run.

for(int i = 10; i > 20; i++){
	System.out.println(i);
}



iteration: each time that loop executes





while loop syntax:
-initialization, termination, update

initialization

while(condition){
	//block of code to be executed
	update
}


int num = 1;

while(num <= 5){
	sout(num);
	num++;
}
