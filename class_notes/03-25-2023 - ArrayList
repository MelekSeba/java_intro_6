Arrays: 
+it is a collection used to store multiple data
+It allows us to manipulate the date inside it
+Allows duplicates
+it can used both with primitives and reference types

-fixed-sized, and you cannot add/remove elements


NOTE: Only arrays can work with primitives while all other collections works only with reference types

Arrays vs ArrayList
-both of them collections and used to store multiple similar data.
-both allows null elements.
-both allows duplicates.
-Arrays are fixed-sized while we can modify ArrayLists by adding or removing elements.
-Arrays can store both primitives and object while ArrayList can only store objects.
-Arrays does not provide many useful methods to update, retrieve elements (instead we use [index]). On the other hand, ArrayList provides many useful methods to get, delete, update, add, etc elements.
