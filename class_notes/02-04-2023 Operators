RECAP:

Naming convention:
Class name: 
	-Meaningful
	-Starts with uppercase
	-Follows camelcase rule
	-It cannot start with digits and specials except _, $ the other currencies
	-It cannot have space

Package name:
	-Meaningful
	-Starts with lowercase
	-Follows camelcase rule
	-It cannot start with digits and specials except
	-It cannot have space (my_package)

public class MyClass{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		// all our code goes here
	}
}


Variable: containers that stores data.
dataType variableName = value;

int age = 25;
String name = "John";

In the above statements, age and name are variables used to store data.


Primitives:
byte, short, int, long 	-> absolute numbers like 2, 10, 35
float, double	 		-> decimal numbers like 2, 10.65, 
char 					-> single character like 'A', '$'
boolean 				-> true or false



int age = 25;
double price = 25;
char var1 = 'e';
boolean b1 = true;
boolean b2 = false;


String var2 = "text";


NOTE: Store all the currency related data in double.

String age = "25";



Scanner: 	
-It is a Java class that helps reading input from user.
-It comes from java.util package
-It has some pre-defined methods for reading different types of data.

next() 		-> reads only one String data from the user
nextLine() 	-> reads the whole line as a String from the user
nextInt() 	-> reads the next absolute number data from the user
nextDouble()-> reads the next decimal number data from the user


HOW TO USE Scanner Object?
1. Create a Scanner object
	Scanner varName = new Scanner(System.in);

	input, myScanner, scanner, scan, inputReader

2. Make sure it is imported from java.util package
3. Use variable name to read data from the user


Redundant: extra code in your program that can be eliminated.


NICE CODE:
Readable: 
	-providing space for the operators
	-meaningful identifiers (variable, class, package, object)

Reusable: reuse your object and variables if possible

Scanner problem for skipping some questions!!!

next(), nextInt(), nextDouble()... 

empty line -> nextLine()

nextLine()
